# Neto Atom Snippets

We now have a nifty little snippets file that'll let you drop whole snippets of b@se code for every function tag right into your file with Atom!

## Installation Instructions

* In Atom,  Select `File > Open Your Snippets` (On OSX, `Atom > Open Your Snippets`)
* Open up our `SNIPPETS.CSON` file
* Copy and paste all of the information from our `SNIPPETS.CSON` into yours being careful not to remove any snippets you may already have.
* All done!
